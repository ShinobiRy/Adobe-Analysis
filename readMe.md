Adobe App Usage Detector is a lightweight Flask-based web application that analyzes system activity logs, file paths, and metadata to intelligently determine which Adobe application was used to open or edit a file.

üîç Key Features:
- Activity History Parsing: Scans recent system activities to trace Adobe app interactions.
- File Path Analysis: Detects application signatures and common folder structures used by different Adobe apps (e.g., Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, etc.).
- Smart App Detection: Matches usage patterns to known Adobe tools based on how files are accessed and modified.
- Web-based Interface: Clean and responsive interface built using HTML, CSS, and JS, rendered through Flask.
